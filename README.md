# slices-endpoints-nuget
This NuGet package simplifies the implementation of minimal APIs within nested, non-static classes, making it an ideal choice for organizing endpoints in vertical slice architecture projects. It provides a clean, modular structure that enhances code organization by grouping related endpoints within feature-based classes.
